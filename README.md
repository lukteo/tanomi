# Tanomi

Tanomi is a mobile app that connects people needing help with those willing to assist, inspired by Japan’s べんり屋 (benriya), or "jack-of-all-trades." Users can post tasks with a monetary reward, and others can accept and complete them to earn the reward.

The app aims to modernize this concept by digitalizing the process, taking a small 3% commission to cover operational costs while remaining accessible and user-friendly.
